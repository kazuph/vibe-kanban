Switch between light and dark themes to suit your preference.

## Default Agent Configuration

Choose the default agent and, if available, a variant. This profile is pre-selected when creating new task attempts and follow-ups.

- Pick an agent (e.g., CLAUDE_CODE, GEMINI, CODEX)
- If that agent has variants, pick one (e.g., DEFAULT, PLAN, ROUTER)
- You can change this per attempt in the create attempt dialog

## Editor Integration

Configure integration with your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code) for a seamless development workflow.

## GitHub Integration

Link your GitHub account by providing a Personal Access Token (PAT) and authenticating. This enables branch management, pull request creation, and status tracking directly from Vibe Kanban.

## Notifications

Toggle sound effects and push notifications to stay informed about task status changes.

## Telemetry

Enable or disable telemetry data collection to help improve Vibe Kanban.

## Task Templates

Manage global task templates to accelerate task creation across all projects. Templates allow you to define a default title and description that can be reused when adding new tasks.
 
You can learn more about task templates on the [Task Templates](/docs/user-guide/creating-task-templates) page.

## Agent Settings (Profiles & Variants)

Define and customize agent variants under Settings → Agents. Variants let you maintain multiple configurations for the same agent (for example a CLAUDE_CODE "PLAN" variant). See the [Agent Profiles & Variants](/docs/user-guide/agent-configurations) guide for details and examples.

Manage acknowledgments and reset options for onboarding, safety disclaimers, and telemetry notices.

- **Onboarding**: Reset the onboarding process to rerun the initial setup.
- **Safety Disclaimer**: Reset or review the safety disclaimer prompt.
