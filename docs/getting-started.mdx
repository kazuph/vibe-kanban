# Install & Run Vibe Kanban

## Supported Systems

We build and test Vibe Kanban on the following systems:

- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux
- Windows

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js
- Coding agent authenticated
  - All supported coding agents can now be used via npx (no separate installation required)
  - You still need to authenticate with each coding agent outside of Vibe Kanban
  - You can find authentication instructions for each coding agent on their respective [websites](./supported-coding-agents).

## Running Vibe Kanban

1. Open a terminal and run:

```
npx vibe-kanban
```

2. [Complete the onboarding steps](/docs/getting-started/onboarding) in the application

3. [Configure Global Settings](/docs/getting-started/global-settings) to personalize your experience

4. [Create a project](/docs/user-guide/creating-projects)

5. [Create tasks](/docs/user-guide/creating-tasks)

6. Optional: [Set up MCP integration](/docs/user-guide/vibe-kanban-mcp-server) to streamline task creation with coding agents

A note on ports: By default the application will bind to a random free port, print the URL in the terminal and attempt to open the link in the default browser. If you would like to use a fixed port you can optionally specify the `PORT` environment variable, so to force Vibe Kanban to start on port 8080 you would run `PORT=8080 npx vibe-kanban`.
