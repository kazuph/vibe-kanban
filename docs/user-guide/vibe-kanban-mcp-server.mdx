# MCP Support

Vibe Kanban ships with an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, allowing you to manage projects and tasks from any coding agent, including coding agents started by vibe-kanban itself.

## Setting Up MCP Integration

### Option 1: Using the Web Interface

This works if you're adding the Vibe Kanban MCP server to any [supported coding agent](/docs/supported-coding-agents).

1. Navigate to the "MCP Servers" page in Vibe Kanban
2. Click the `Add Vibe-Kanban MCP` button
3. Click the `Save Settings` button

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

You can manually add the MCP server to your coding agent's configuration. Add the following configuration to your agent's MCP servers configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe_kanban": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vibe-kanban", "--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using MCP with Coding Agents

Once you have the MCP server configured, you can leverage it to streamline your project planning workflow:

1. **Plan Your Work**: Describe a large feature or project to your coding agent
2. **Request Task Creation**: At the end of your task description, simply add "then turn this plan into tasks"
3. **Automatic Task Generation**: Your coding agent will use the Vibe Kanban MCP server to automatically create structured tasks in your project

## Example Usage

```
I need to build a user authentication system with the following features:
- User registration with email validation
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset capability
- Session management
- Protected routes

Then turn this plan into tasks.
```

The coding agent will break this down into individual tasks and add them to your Vibe Kanban project automatically.
