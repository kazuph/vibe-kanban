# Task Attempts

Task attempts represent one run of a coding agent against a task. Any follow up questions in the same coding agent session will be attached to the same task attempt.

## Running Setup Scripts

When you start a task attempt, if specified in the project settings, the setup script is run automatically.

## Running Coding Agents

After any setup scripts have run, the coding agent is executed with your task title and description in the prompt. The agent's logs are streamed back to the UI in real time.

### Profiles & Variants

Before starting, select an agent profile (agent) and, if available, a variant. Profiles and variants let you quickly switch between different configurations for the same agent (for example a planning-focused variant). You can manage these under Settings â†’ Agents. See [Agent Profiles & Variants](/docs/user-guide/agent-configurations) for details.

## Follow Up questions

When the execution has finished, you can ask a follow up question using the box at the bottom of the task attempt dialog.

## Task Attempt Toolbar

You can use the task attempt toolbar to perform useful actions:

- `Dev Server` - Start a dev server (this will kill any existing dev servers running in this project)
- `History` - View any previous attempts at this task
- `Rebase` - If enabled, communicates that the task branch is behind its base branch, if clicked will attempt to rebase (will fail on conflict)
- `Create PR` - Opens a dialog to create a PR in GitHub
- `Merge` - Merges the branch into its base branch
- `New Attempt` - Opens the create attempt dialog so you can start over

## Worktrees

Under the hood, Vibe Kanban relies on Git worktrees to create isolated environments for each task attempt. These should be considered ephemeral and are automatically cleaned up after each run.
