# Creating Tasks

![Creating a task](/images/screenshot-create-task.png)

Once you've created a project, you can add tasks by clicking the `Add Task` button in the navigation section of the project kanban page. Creating a task adds it to the project's kanban board, but doesn't automatically start trying to work on the task with a coding agent.

## Using Templates

When adding a new task, you can choose from your global or project templates via the **Use a template** dropdown. Selecting a template will prefill the task title and description based on your chosen template. See [Task Templates](/docs/user-guide/creating-task-templates) for details.

## Task Attempts

To start a coding agent working on a task you'll need to create a task attempt. You can specify the base branch, the agent to use, and (if available) a variant. By default your currently checked out branch and your default agent configuration (from Settings) are selected.

- Select Profile: pick the agent (e.g., CLAUDE_CODE, GEMINI, CODEX)
- Select Variant: if the chosen agent has variants, pick one (e.g., DEFAULT, PLAN)

_Tip: "Create & Start" adds the task to the board and immediately creates a task attempt using your default agent configuration._

You can learn more about task attempts on the [Task Attempts](./creating-task-attempts) page.

## Columns

Tasks are added to the "To do" column, and can be freely dragged into any column. Dragging a task into a particular column won't trigger any functionality, but the task may move into a different column based on actions that are taken like starting coding agents. These are documented below:

- Task attempt created: task moves to `In Progress`
- Task attempt finished (success or failure): task moves to `In Review`
- Task attempt merged: task moves to `Done`
- Task attempt PR merged on GitHub: task moves to `Done` (polls GitHub every 60s)
