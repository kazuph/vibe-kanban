# Onboarding

When you first run Vibe Kanban (`npx vibe-kanban`), you'll be guided through an onboarding process to configure the application for your workflow. During onboarding, you will:

- Choose your default agent configuration (agent and optional variant)
- Authenticate with GitHub for branch management and PR tracking
- Set up your initial workspace directory

Once onboarding is complete, you'll be ready to create your first project and start tracking tasks.
